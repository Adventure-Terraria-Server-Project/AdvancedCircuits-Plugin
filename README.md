Advanced Circuits Plugin
================================

####The Revolutionized Wiring

Advanced Circuits is the long awaited revolution of the Terraria wiring mechanism, adding a completely rewritten and extended wiring engine to TerrariaAPI and TShock driven Terraria servers.

Beside keeping and extending Terraria's Vanilla Circuits and components, a new type of circuit is added called "Advanced Circuit" giving players the freedom of building complex systems using binary logic and new types of components.

Several configuration settings give the server's owner control of wiring limits and capabilities. This also includes a mighty configuration mechanism of Statues and their performed actions when powered.

Note: This plugin requires Terraria Server API 1.12 and TShock 4 in order to work.

More information to this plugin can be found [here](tshock/Advanced Circuits/ReadMe.txt).
